                    <p>Paris, France</p>
                    <div class="card-divider"></div>
                    <p class="card-description">Iconic iron lattice tower standing 330 meters tall, one of the most recognizable structures in the world. The Eiffel Tower is a wrought-iron lattice tower located in Paris, France, named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, who designed and built it from 1887 to 1889.
                        It was constructed as the centerpiece of the 1889 World's Fair to celebrate the centennial of the French Revolution.
                        Initially criticized by some artists and intellectuals for its design, it has since become a global cultural icon of France and one of the most recognizable structures in the world.
                       
                       The tower stands at 330 meters (1,083 feet) tall, including the antenna, making it the tallest structure in Paris.
                        It was the tallest structure in the world until surpassed by the Chrysler Building in 1930 and the KCTV Broadcast Tower in 1956.
                        The tower received 5,889,000 visitors in 2022 and is the most visited monument with an entrance fee in the world.
                       
                       The Eiffel Tower was designated a monument historique in 1964 and was named part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site ("Paris, Banks of the Seine") in 1991.
                        It has been used for various purposes, including military radio posts and broadcasting television.
                       
                       Width of a pillar: 82 feet (on the ground).
                       Lifts: 5 lifts from the esplanade to the second floor, 2 x 2 duolifts from the second floor to the top.
                       The design of the tower is attributed to Maurice Koechlin and Émile Nouguier, with contributions from Stephen Sauvestre, who added decorative arches and a glass pavilion to the first level.</p>

                    <div class="card-divider"></div>
                    <p class="card-description">White marble mausoleum built by Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his favorite wife. The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum located on the right bank of the river Yamuna in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India. It was built by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in 1631 as a mausoleum for his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal, who died during childbirth. The construction was completed in 1648, but work continued on other phases of the project for another five years.

                        The Taj Mahal complex covers 17 hectares (42 acres) and includes a mosque and a guest house, set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall. It is renowned for its stunning architecture, which blends Indo-Islamic and Mughal styles, and is considered a masterpiece of Islamic art in India.
                        
                        The Taj Mahal attracts millions of visitors each year. In the financial year 2022–23, about five million visitors visited the Taj Mahal. The complex is open every day except Friday, from one hour before sunrise to 45 minutes before sunset. Limited night viewing is available on the day of the full moon, excluding the month of Ramadan.
                        
                        The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being "the jewel of Islamic art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage".</p>
