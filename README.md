Okay, so I built this travel website. Let me walk you through how I did it. First, I wanted something simple but professional, so I stuck with basic HTML and CSS—no fancy frameworks or anything.
The Structure:
I made four pages:

Homepage (index.html): Has a login/register form and a search bar.

About Page: Shows famous landmarks like the Eiffel Tower and Taj Mahal with cool descriptions.

Contact Page: Just a basic form for people to message me.

Reviews Page: Where users can leave ratings and feedback.

All the pages share the same navigation bar at the top, so it feels consistent. I reused the same CSS file (style.css) for everything to keep it simple.

Styling Choices:
I wanted it to look modern, so I used:

Soft shadows on cards and forms to make them "pop."

CSS Grid for the landmark cards on the About page—they automatically rearrange on smaller screens!

Variables for colors (like --primary and --secondary) so I could tweak the theme quickly.

Gradient overlay on the homepage background to make the text readable over the image.

What I’d Do Differently:

Add a mobile menu—the navigation looks squished on phones.

Use real form validation (right now, it’s just HTML’s basic "required" attribute).

Maybe add some JavaScript for animations or interactive features.

Overall: It was a mix of Googling, trial-and-error, and AI help. I’m proud of how it turned out, but I’ve got a list of tweaks for the future"
